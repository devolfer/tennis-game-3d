# Tennis Game 3D

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my little tennis game! I've always been a fan of tennis in general and decided to make a little tennis game in **Unity**. For the moment the game consists of a simple training mode, in which the player needs to return as many correct shots as possible in order to achieve a highscore.

## Controls
The game can be played via _Keyboard & Mouse_ OR _Gamepad_:

* **Move**: WASD/Arrow Keys OR Left Stick
* **Aim**: Mouse Delta OR Right Stick
* **Flat**: Left Mouse Button OR Right Shoulder
* **Top Spin**: Right Mouse Button OR Right Trigger
* **Slice**: Space OR Left Shoulder
* **Drop Shot/Lob**: Left Shift OR Left Trigger
* **Pause**: Escape OR Start

## Technologies
* Unity 2020.2
* .NET 4.x / C# 8.0

## Final words
As this is a personal project, my code lacks commenting/explanations most of the time (which I might change in the future). Feel free to contact me if anything is unclear!
