# Tennis Game 3D

## Introduction
Hello and welcome! I've always been a fan of tennis in general and decided to make a little tennis game in **Unity**. For the moment the game consists of a simple training mode, in which the player needs to return as many correct shots as possible in order to achieve a highscore.

## Controls
The game can be played via _Keyboard & Mouse_ OR _Gamepad_:

* **Move**: WASD/Arrow Keys OR Left Stick
* **Aim**: Mouse Delta OR Right Stick
* **Flat**: Left Mouse Button OR Right Shoulder
* **Top Spin**: Right Mouse Button OR Right Trigger
* **Slice**: Space OR Left Shoulder
* **Drop Shot/Lob**: Left Shift OR Left Trigger
* **Pause**: Escape OR Start

To switch between different shots, simply press the corresponding button once at any time. As long as the ball touches the hitting zone of the player character (green box), it will automatically be hit towards the aiming point at the other side of the net.

## Technologies
* Unity 2021.2
* .NET 4.x / C# 8.0

## Final words
As this is a solo personal project, my code lacks commenting/explanations most of the time (which I might change in the future). Feel free to contact me if anything is unclear!
